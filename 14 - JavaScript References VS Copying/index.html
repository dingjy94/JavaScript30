    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const copy = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // copy[0] = 'Is';

    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(players[0]) - 'Is'

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copySlice = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copyConcat = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copySpread = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const personCopy = Object.assign({}, person);

    // object ...spread
    const personSpread = { ...person };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
